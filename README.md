# appkit-lakebase

A Databricks App powered by [AppKit](https://developers.databricks.com/docs/appkit/v0/), featuring React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

**Enabled plugins:**

- **Lakebase** -- Fully managed Postgres database for transactional (OLTP) workloads on Databricks
- **Server** -- Express HTTP server with static file serving and Vite dev mode

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v22+ and npm
- Databricks CLI (for deployment)
- Access to a Databricks workspace

## Databricks Authentication

### Local Development

For local development, configure your environment variables by creating a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set the environment variables you need:

```env
DATABRICKS_HOST=https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com
DATABRICKS_APP_PORT=8000
# ... other environment variables, depending on the plugins you use
```

#### Lakebase Configuration

The Lakebase plugin requires additional environment variables for PostgreSQL connectivity. To learn how to configure the Lakebase plugin, see the [Lakebase plugin documentation](https://developers.databricks.com/docs/appkit/v0/plugins/lakebase).

### CLI Authentication

The Databricks CLI requires authentication to deploy and manage apps. Configure authentication using one of these methods:

#### OAuth U2M

Interactive browser-based authentication with short-lived tokens:

```bash
databricks auth login --host https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com
```

This will open your browser to complete authentication. The CLI saves credentials to `~/.databrickscfg`.

#### Configuration Profiles

Use multiple profiles for different workspaces:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
host = https://dev-workspace.cloud.databricks.com

[production]
host = https://prod-workspace.cloud.databricks.com
client_id = prod-client-id
client_secret = prod-client-secret
```

Deploy using a specific profile:

```bash
databricks bundle deploy --profile production
```

**Note:** Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are legacy authentication. OAuth is strongly recommended for better security.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Run the app in development mode with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at the URL shown in the console output.

### Build

Build both client and server for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates:

- `dist/server.js` - Compiled server bundle
- `client/dist/` - Bundled client assets

### Production

Run the production build:

```bash
npm start
```

## Code Quality

There are a few commands to help you with code quality:

```bash
# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix

# Formatting
npm run format
npm run format:fix
```

## Database migrations

Schema changes are managed with [`node-pg-migrate`](https://github.com/salsita/node-pg-migrate).
Migration files live in `migrations/` and are committed to Git — they are the
single source of truth for the schema and are replayed identically against
every Lakebase branch (preview and production). The app no longer creates
tables at boot.

Migrations connect to Lakebase via `@databricks/lakebase`, which mints and
refreshes the short-lived OAuth database token automatically — no token is ever
written to disk.

```bash
# Point the migration tooling at a branch (resolves PGHOST / LAKEBASE_ENDPOINT / …)
eval "$(bash scripts/lakebase-connect-env.sh projects/<project>/branches/<branch>)"

npm run migrate:create -- add-something   # scaffold migrations/<ts>_add-something.js
npm run migrate:up                        # apply pending migrations
npm run migrate:down                      # roll back the most recent migration
```

**How changes reach production:** you never merge a database branch back.
On a pull request, the `Migrate & Test (Preview Branch)` workflow applies the
migrations to the PR's preview branch and runs the tests against real Postgres.
On merge to `main`, the `Migrate Production` workflow replays the same committed
files against the `production` branch. Keep migrations idempotent and additive
(expand/contract) so the running app stays compatible across the deploy.

## Deployment with Databricks Asset Bundles

### 1. Configure Bundle

Update `databricks.yml` with your workspace settings:

```yaml
targets:
  default:
    workspace:
      host: https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com
```

Make sure to replace all placeholder values in `databricks.yml` with your actual resource IDs.

### 2. Deploy

Deploy and start the app with a single command:

```bash
databricks apps deploy
```

`databricks apps deploy` validates the project, deploys it, starts the app, and prints its URL.

### Deploy to Production

1. Configure the production target in `databricks.yml`
2. Deploy to production:

```bash
databricks apps deploy -t prod
```

> **Restarting a stopped app:** apps stop after a period of inactivity. To start one again without redeploying, run `databricks apps start <APP_NAME>`.
